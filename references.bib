% How to manage your references
%
% Decide what format this reference best fits into.
% i.e. Is it a book? A website? A news article? Conference proceedings? A journal article?
%
% Copy the correct format and replace the sample data with your reference's information
%
% Decide on the way to structure the keywords by which you cite these references, the part inside \cite{keywordHere}. I like to use the first author's name and the year. This is generally unique. Is citing lots of articles by the same set of authors the addition of a number or month could work well. Referencing tools may generate a unique number for each reference (such as 2649387-777), these are hard to remember I find, whereas the author's name and year helps you to recall what you are citing.
% i.e. lantair2019 or surnameThisyear
%
% Tips : Capitalisation in titles may be done by surrounding those letters to be upper case in {}, {T}itles {L}ook {N}ice {W}ith {C}apitals
%        Each author's name needs to be separated with the word and
%        More data is better than too little data
%        A reference per key point is decent
%        You're probably looking for ten quality, recent references for an ILM submission
